Brushed DC and Stepper motor examples
=====================================

Introduction
++++++++++++

Motors can be divided into different types.  XMOS provides a solution for electrically commutating Brushless
DC Motors and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors, in the *sw_motor_control* open source repository.

The sw_basic_motor_examples provides two alternative uses for the *XP_MC_LVM2* power and control boards.  The
first provides speed control of two brushed DC motors.  The second provides position control of a two coil
stepper motor.

Supported hardware
++++++++++++++++++

The XMOS *XP_MC_LVM2* kit contains a control board and a power board.  These can be used to control both
the DC and stepper motor examples.

Brushed DC motors come in many standard voltages. Stepper motors are more commonly 12V.  The motors which
were used to build these demonstration applications are both 12V.

The brushed DC motors are Hennkwell HG37D670WE12-052 DC gear motor.  It has 12V coils, a built in 2
channel QEI encoder, and a 52:1 gear head.

The stepper motor is a two coil Astrosyn 12V stepper.

*NOTE* - The power board in the *XP_MC_LVM2* kit is designed for 24V, but will work with a 12V power supply with a
single modification.  The undervoltage protection circuit needs modification.  The resistor R99,
initially 140 Kohm, must be replaced with a 68 Kohm one.
